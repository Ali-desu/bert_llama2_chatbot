# BERT Llama2 Medical Chatbot

This repository contains code for a medical chatbot powered by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically trained on medical data using the Llama2 framework.

## About the Chatbot

The chatbot utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques to provide responses to medical queries. It's designed to understand and respond to a wide range of medical-related questions and inquiries.

## Usage

To utilize the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Training the Model**: Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook (`medical_intent_detector_using_bert.ipynb`) to train the BERT model on medical data. This step is crucial for the chatbot to work , if you run it on cpu it might takes a long time (2 hours max) 
2. **Running the Chatbot**: Execute `chatbot.py` to run the chatbot application.
